A machine-learning genetic algorithm built from the ground up using research from the University of Texas-Austin "Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies" capable of playing and completing a real Super Mario Bros 1-1 ROM utilizing a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. This project has been awarded "Best Technical Skills" from the [Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) on April 17, 2023.
